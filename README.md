Otamata-iOS
===========

Otamata iOS application
-----------------------

The source code is here mostly for academic purposes.  

Unfortunately, there is some sensitive data in the config.h file, so it's not included here.  So this probably won't compile.  Let me know if you need a version and I can try to create one.

This version of the app failed to be approved by Apple for the app store, although the previous version is currently in the app store.

There's a backend API supporting the app as well, written in C#.  If it's not on Github yet, please check back soon. 

Description
-----------

The whole point is to play funny sound effects quickly from the home screen.
